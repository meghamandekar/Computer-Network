- In order to transfer the packets from source to the destination, the network layer must determine the best route through which packets can be transmitted.

# Classification of a Routing algorithm
The Routing algorithm is divided into two categories:

1. Adaptive Routing algorithm - 
- An adaptive routing algorithm is also known as dynamic routing algorithm.
- This algorithm makes the routing decisions based on the topology and network traffic.
- The main parameters related to this algorithm are hop count, distance and estimated transit time.

2. Non-adaptive Routing algorithm
- Non Adaptive routing algorithm is also known as a static routing algorithm.

- Non Adaptive routing algorithms do not take the routing decision based on the network topology or network traffic.
