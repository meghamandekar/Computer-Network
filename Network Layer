# Network Layer
- The Network Layer is the third layer of the OSI model.

- It handles the service requests from the transport layer and further forwards the service request to the data link layer.

- The network layer translates the logical addresses into physical addresses.

- The main role of the network layer is to move the packets from sending host to the receiving host.

- A router is different from the host in that it has two or more links that connect to it.

- An IP address would look like 193.32.216.9 where 193 represents the decimal notation of first 8 bits of an address, 32 represents the decimal notation of second 8 bits of an address.

- The first part (first three bytes in IP address) specifies the network and second part (last byte of an IP address) specifies the host in the network.

- An ip address is divided into two parts:

Network ID: It represents the number of networks.
Host ID: It represents the number of hosts.

- An IP address is 32-bit long. An IP address is divided into sub-classes:

Class A -
The network ID is 8 bits long.
The host ID is 24 bits long.

Class B -
The Network ID is 16 bits long.
The Host ID is 16 bits long.

Class C -
The Network ID is 24 bits long.
The host ID is 8 bits long.

Class D -
-  The higher order bits of the first octet is always set to 1110, and the remaining bits determines the host ID in any network.

Class E -
The higher order bits of the first octet is always set to 1111, and the remaining bits determines the host ID in any network.

- A Router is a process of selecting path along which the data can be transferred from source to the destination. Routing is performed by a special device known as a router.

# ARP
- ARP stands for Address Resolution Protocol.
- It is used to associate an IP address with the MAC address.
- Therefore, we can say that devices need the MAC address for communication on a local area network. MAC address can be changed easily. For example, if the NIC on a particular machine fails, the MAC address changes but IP address does not change. ARP is used to find the MAC address of the node when an internet address is known.

How ARP works?
ARP broadcasts a request packet to all the machines on the LAN and asks if any of the machines are using that particular IP address. When a machine recognizes the IP address as its own, it sends a reply so ARP can update the cache for future reference and proceed with the communication.
