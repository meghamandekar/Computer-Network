# Digital Transmission
Data can be represented either in analog or digital form. The computers used the digital form to store the information. Therefore, the data needs to be converted in digital form so that it can be used by a computer.

# DIGITAL-TO-DIGITAL CONVERSION
 - When binary 1s and 0s generated by the computer are translated into a sequence of voltage pulses that can be propagated over a wire, this process is known as digital-to-digital encoding.

 3 types
 1. Unipolar
Digital transmission system sends the voltage pulses over the medium link such as wire or cable.

- In Unipolar Encoding, '1' is considered as a high voltage and '0' is considered as a zero voltage

2. Polar
Polar encoding is an encoding scheme that uses two voltage levels: one is positive, and another is negative.

3.  Bipolar
Bipolar encoding scheme represents three voltage levels: positive, negative, and zero.

# ANALOG-TO-DIGITAL CONVERSION
- When an analog signal is digitalized, this is called an analog-to-digital conversion.
Suppose human sends a voice in the form of an analog signal, we need to digitalize the analog signal which is less prone to noise. It requires a reduction in the number of values in an analog message so that they can be represented in the digital stream.

1. PAM
- PAM stands for pulse amplitude modulation.
- PAM is a technique used in analog-to-digital conversion.
- PAM technique takes an analog signal, samples it, and generates a series of digital pulses based on the result of sampling where sampling means measuring the amplitude of a signal at equal intervals.

2, PCM
- PCM stands for Pulse Code Modulation.
- PCM technique is used to modify the pulses created by PAM to form a digital signal. To achieve this, PCM quantizes PAM pulses. Quantization is a process of assigning integral values in a specific range to sampled instances.


# What is Transmission media?
- Transmission media is a communication channel that carries the information from the sender to the receiver. Data is transmitted through the electromagnetic signals.

Causes Of Transmission Impairment:
- Attenuation: Attenuation means the loss of energy.
- Distortion: Distortion occurs when there is a change in the shape of the signal.
- Noise: When data is travelled over a transmission medium, some unwanted signal is added to it which creates the noise.

# Guided Media
It is defined as the physical medium through which the signals are transmitted. 

1. Twisted pair:
Twisted pair is a physical media made up of a pair of cables twisted with each other. A twisted pair cable is cheap as compared to other transmission media. 

Ex- Ethernet networks

2. Coaxial Cable
Coaxial cable is very commonly used transmission media, for example, TV wire is usually a coaxial cable.

3. Fibre Optic
Fibre optic cable is a cable that uses electrical signals for communication.
Ex- Internet Service Provider (ISP)

# Unguided transmission
An unguided transmission transmits the electromagnetic waves without using any physical medium. Therefore it is also known as wireless transmission.

1. Radio waves
Radio waves are the electromagnetic waves that are transmitted in all the directions of free space.

2. Microwaves

3. Infrared
An infrared transmission is a wireless technology used for communication over short ranges.

# Multiplexing
Multiplexing is a technique used to combine and send the multiple data streams over a single medium. The process of combining the data streams is known as multiplexing and hardware used for multiplexing is known as a multiplexer.

- Multiplexing is achieved by using a device called Multiplexer (MUX) that combines n input lines to generate a single output line. Multiplexing follows many-to-one.

- Demultiplexing is achieved by using a device called Demultiplexer (DEMUX) available at the receiving end. DEMUX separates a signal into its component signals (one input and n outputs). Therefore, we can say that demultiplexing follows the one-to-many.

# Switching
- This technique of transferring the information from one computer network to another network is known as switching.

- The layer 2 switches are used for transmitting the data on the data link layer, and it also performs error checking on transmitted and received frames.

- The layer 2 switches forward the packets with the help of MAC address.

# Switching techniques
1. Circuit Switching
Circuit switching is a switching technique that establishes a dedicated path between sender and receiver.

2. Message Switching
Message Switching is a switching technique in which a message is transferred as a complete unit and routed through intermediate nodes at which it is stored and forwarded.

3. Packet Switching
The packet switching is a switching technique in which the message is sent in one go, but it is divided into smaller pieces, and they are sent individually.
